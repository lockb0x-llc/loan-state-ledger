Loan State Ledger
Subtitle: Solving the Agency Dilemma in the $5T Syndicated Loan Market
Footer: LMA EDGE Hackathon Submission
2
The Problem: The Agency Dilemma
Header: The $5 Trillion "Telephone Game"
- Information Asymmetry: Agent Bank holds the golden record; others rely on delayed reports.
- The Agency Cost:
- Hours reconciling Excel vs. PDFs
- Delayed draws and payments due to state ambiguity
- Zero real-time visibility into risk (covenant breaches)
- Core Friction: Trust relies on manual verification, not cryptographic proof.
3
The Solution: A Deterministic System of Record
- One Ledger, One Truth: Shared, append-only, immutable ledger per facility
- State, Not Messages: Transitions like Pending → Asserted → Effective
- Golden Source: Everyone sees the same computed state; reconciliation eliminated
- Not a document repo: It’s a state machine for Drawdowns, Rate Sets, Waivers
4
Smart Covenants: Automating Compliance with Azure AI
- The Bottleneck: 100-page Compliance Certificates buried in emails
- Our Innovation: "Auto-Covenant" Bots
- Ingest: Azure AI Document Intelligence extracts financial data from PDFs
- Compute: System calculates covenant metrics (e.g., Net Leverage = Debt / EBITDA)
- Assert: Bot posts Pass/Fail event directly to the ledger
- Result: Real-time risk signaling instead of 45-day delays
5
Product Demo: Live Prototype
Visuals: Portfolio Dashboard, Event Timeline, New Event Form
Key Workflows:
1) Dashboard: Instant view of Global Exposure (~$250M) and Pending Actions
2) Timeline: Clear history of who did what and when
3) Action: Borrower asserts a Waiver; Lenders see it instantly
6
Technical Architecture
- Frontend: Next.js (React Server Components) for performance
- State Engine: Deterministic State Resolver (TypeScript)
- AI/ML: Azure AI Document Intelligence for unstructured data
- Deployment: Vercel / Azure Static Web Apps (Edge optimized)
- Note: Link-first architecture; state logic decoupled from UI; portable across blockchain or SQL backends
7
Market & Business Model
- Market: Global Syndicated Loans > $5T
- Target Customer:
- Primary: Administrative Agents (Banks) reducing Ops cost
- Secondary: Private Credit Funds needing real-time monitoring
- Revenue Model:
- Per-Facility Fee: e.g., 1 bps for Digital Agency service
- Seat License: Premium analytics for Lenders
8
Vision & Roadmap: From Ledger to Marketplace
- Phase 1 (Now): System of Record (Prototype)
- Phase 2 (Next): Smart Contracts automate movement of funds based on ledger state
- Phase 3 (Future): Secondary trading with instant settlement via transparent truth
9
The Ask
- Why Us:
- Insight: We understand the Agency Dilemma
